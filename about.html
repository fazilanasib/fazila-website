      <h1>About me</h1>
      <h3>Front-end developer from Virginia, USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</h3>
      <div class="about-paragraphs text-center">
        <p>
          <strong>Past:</strong> I am originally from Nangrahar, Afghanistan. My
          family moved to Peshawar, Pakistan which is where I was born due to
          the on-going conflicts in Afghanistan. When I turned eight years old,
          I moved to the United States.
          <br />
          <br />
          My father would send us back to Afghanistan every summer in order to
          expand our knowledge of our own culture and not lose interest in what
          is the one thing he cares for and that is the land of his ancestors.
          My father has been successful in his goal and my love for Afghanistan
          ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡« grows every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Present:</strong> For the longest time, my interests weren't
          clear to me. Due to this, I have always switched on and off from
          careers, hobbies, etc. For example, at a point, I thought I would
          become a great sportsperson but never gave myself a chance.
          <br />
          <br />
          Then, there was a time where I felt healthcare was a field I would
          love to work all my life. As soon as I worked in healthcare, there
          wasn't a day I wasn't looking forward to going home. This is when I
          decided that I needed to do something that interests me and be
          consistent with it. Finally, I gave web development a chance and here
          I am, loving every minute of it.
